# MPC-FaF
This repository contains my course project report from CS 758 - Advanced Tools from Modern Cryptography, Spring 2022.

I studied the paper "MPC with Friends and Foes" by Alon, Omri, and Paskin-Cherniavsky, which proposes a new security definition, by extending the classical notion of standalone MPC security to prevent honest parties from revealing their private inputs to each other, even when a malicious party tries to facilitate such leakage.
